# Implementation Guide

How to build each component. Follow this order — later steps depend on earlier ones.

## Starter Placeholders

The scaffold ships with working-but-meaningless values. **Confirm every one with the user:**

| Placeholder | Where |
|---|---|
| `subject: "BTCUSDT"` | CrunchConfig, tracker, examples, `.local.env` |
| `horizon_seconds: 60` | `scheduled_predictions` |
| `prediction_interval_seconds: 15` | `scheduled_predictions` |
| `FEED_SOURCE: pyth` | `.local.env` |
| `FEED_GRANULARITY: 1s` | `.local.env` |
| `InferenceOutput.value: float` | `crunch_config.py`, tracker, scoring |
| `scoring: return 0.0` | `scoring.py` (stub) |
| `ranking_key: score_recent` | `Aggregation` |

If the user says "use defaults," ask which specific values they mean.

## Use Tests as Implementation Targets

```bash
make test
```

Three test files track your progress:
- `test_tracker.py` — TrackerBase behavior (passes out of the box)
- `test_examples.py` — example models match `InferenceOutput` contract (breaks when you change types without updating examples)
- `test_scoring.py` — has `xfail(strict=True)` markers that detect the 0.0 stub. **Remove xfail markers after implementing real scoring** — strict xfail that unexpectedly passes = test failure.

## 1. Types and Tracker

Define the contract first — what models receive and what they return.

**Types** — edit `node/config/crunch_config.py`:
- `RawInput` — what the feed produces
- `InferenceInput` — what models receive (can transform from RawInput)
- `InferenceOutput` — what models return (this is the core design decision)
- `ScoreResult` — what scoring produces (define after scoring, step 3)

**Tracker** — edit `challenge/starter_challenge/tracker.py`:
- `tick(data)` — receives market data, maintains state per-subject via `data["symbol"]`
- `predict(subject, resolve_horizon_seconds, step_seconds)` — returns dict matching `InferenceOutput`

The tracker defines the participant interface. What `predict()` returns IS the competition.

## 2. Examples

Edit `challenge/starter_challenge/examples/`. Build ~3-5 simple models:
- **Simple logic** — mean-reversion, trend-follow, always-long, etc.
- **Diverse** — different strategies so they produce different scores/rankings
- **Predictable** — you should know roughly what to expect from each
- **Contract-compliant** — `predict()` returns a dict matching `InferenceOutput`

These are NOT just quickstarters for participants — they are **your E2E test models**. After `make deploy`, they run through the full pipeline. If they break, you can't verify the system works.

Run `make test` — `test_examples.py` and `test_tracker.py` should pass.

## 3. Feeds

Edit `node/.local.env`: `FEED_SOURCE`, `FEED_SUBJECTS`, `FEED_KIND`, `FEED_GRANULARITY`.

**`resolve_horizon_seconds` must exceed feed granularity** — otherwise the score worker's fetch_window returns zero records and predictions silently fail to score.

## 4. Ground Truth Resolution

How "what actually happened" is derived from feed data. If this returns None or zero, all scores are zero regardless of model quality.

- Default: compares first/last record's close price → `entry_price`, `resolved_price`, `profit`, `direction_up`
- Override: set `CrunchConfig.resolve_ground_truth` for custom logic

**Verify** non-zero returns with your feed granularity. A 60s horizon with 1m candles may produce 0.0 returns if only one candle falls in the window.

## 5. Scoring Function

Now that you know what models produce (step 1-2) and what ground truth looks like (step 4), define evaluation.

A stub returning 0.0 produces meaningless leaderboards silently — everything "works" but nothing is real.

1. Implement in `challenge/starter_challenge/scoring.py` (already wired as `SCORING_FUNCTION` in `node/.local.env`)
2. Remove `xfail` markers from `challenge/tests/test_scoring.py`
3. Run `make test` — all green

**Receives:** `prediction` (dict matching `InferenceOutput`), `ground_truth` (dict from `resolve_ground_truth`)
**Returns:** dict matching `ScoreResult` — at minimum `{"value": float, "success": bool, "failed_reason": str | None}`

Now update `ScoreResult` in `node/config/crunch_config.py` if your scoring returns additional fields.

**Key consistency check:** the score worker dry-runs the scoring function at startup against default `InferenceOutput` and `GroundTruth` values. A `KeyError` raises a hard `RuntimeError` — check `make logs` if the score worker fails to start.
